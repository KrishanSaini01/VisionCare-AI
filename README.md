# 📌 Overview

VisionCare AI is a next-generation **Medical Image Analysis Platform** developed as a **Final Year Computer Science Engineering Project**.

The platform combines **Deep Learning (CNN)**, **Generative AI**, and a **Relational Database** to assist users in analyzing medical images and understanding AI predictions.

Users can upload medical images (such as Chest X-rays, Brain MRI, CT Scans, or Skin Lesion images), and the CNN model predicts the possible disease. After prediction, Generative AI explains the results in easy-to-understand language, generates medical summaries, answers follow-up questions, and creates downloadable PDF reports.

The system securely stores users, uploaded images, prediction history, reports, and conversations in a relational database.
